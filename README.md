Hello World, this is the first version about my resumé or curriculum vitae. I strongly believed that have something to show about you is very important nowadays. On the near future I will updated with the new technologies that I would like to learn, and also, with the link to my website.

It has a section on the technologies to explain a little bit more how I learnt about it.

I would like to thank to [Dennis Snellenberg](https://www.dennissnellenberg.nl/en) for his [icons library website](https://angularicons.com/).

This website resumé version is looking for show to people what I know, and what I can do for you. Moreover, when I have my own website this information is going to be more explained. For now, that's it.

I hope you like :D

License Script: I uploaded this resumé webpage public because, it will help you. You could modify anything you want and help me with issues this version should have.
